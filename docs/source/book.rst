Motivation
==========

This book attempts to fill the gap that exists in quantitative finance books and courses that only focus
on the mean-variance model and its variants, and ignore the further developments made in the last 70 years
after the publication of Markowitz's pioneering work. Readers will find this book very useful because each
section explains the idea and mathematics of each model, and each section is accompanied by its corresponding
Python code that allows all the examples to be reproduced.
